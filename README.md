For an Intelligent Campus Information System, documentation should cover:
- System Overview: Purpose, scope, and goals (like assisting students with campus queries).
- Features:
    - Interactive chatbot functionality.
    - Modules for academic schedules, facility timings, campus events.
    - Query handling for dining, library, admin procedures.
- Technical Details: AI tech used, database structure, integration methods.
- User Guide: How students interact with the chatbot, navigation tips.
- Maintenance & Updates: How to update info, handle bugs.

Do you want me to help draft a basic documentation template or focus on a specific part of theÂ documentation?
